# homefashion_selenium
Selenium tests for Home Fashion system. I used JUnit, Selenium, Faker Data, Page Objects, Suites and Maven in the project.

Before running the tests, visit https://home-fashion.herokuapp.com/ to activate the server, the heroku server sleeps if not used in the last 30 minutes.
